I've made the decision to finally pick up Unreal Engine. After years of having it installed, opening it occasionally, only to close it soon after out of intimidation and confusion, I'm finally going to give it a go in ernest.

While I'm no expert in any facet of game development, the bulk of my experience is with Unity. I'm comfortable enough there that I can fairly easily jam out a small prototype or bit of gameplay in an hour or so. At least enough to get the point across.


Why am I switching?
- Split between Unity Personal/Plus/Pro
- Unity's Heavy focus on services
- Blueprints seems like an excellent way to do scripting
- While Unity is gaining ground in the indie space, Unreal/C++ still dominates AAA
- I have a tendency to fall back into my 2D comfort zone when using Unity. I need to explore the 3D space more fully, and I think this will be easier to do in the long run with UE4.
- Less tempted to buy a macbook pro, now that I've tried UE4 out on a nearly top of the line machine. Seems to me that a ~$1500 Windows laptop would do a better job of running it.
- Something about Unity just rubs me the wrong way. I don't feel good using it. GameMakerStudio2 is more fun to use, somehow. I'm hoping that UE4 starts to feel that same way after some practice.

Unity just doesn't feel like a professional tool, somehow. It is certainly possible that my feelings about it are colored by my familiarity with it, but I actually don't think that's it. I remember feeling similarly about it when I started out with it years ago. I had incorrectly assumed that the feeling would fade once I was more skilled.

Expected pain points
- C++
- Paradigm shifts/different naming conventions
- Mobile development/laptop capable of running UE editor (much more feasible with Unity)

It won't be easy, of courseâˆ’learning never is. Still, I think it will be worth it in the long run. If not, then at least I'll finally know for sure ðŸ˜„.
