I feel trapped; like I'm jamming on the gas but my wheels are just spinning in place.

Trapped in a job I don't like, in a state I don't want to be in. Perhaps it goes even deeper but I choose not to entertain that notion. How do I get out? Where can I run? With ACA on the sunset, my faint dream that I might one day run my own small business from home has basically been shattered.

The baseline requirements for successful self-employment have just increased dramatically.

I wonder sometimes if I'll ever break out of this cycle. The skills I gain at work are not applicable to anything but what I'm already doing, which is something I don't want to continue doing. I strive to learn additional skills at home, but time is precious, and there are other aspects of my life which demand care and attention. Things which are arguably more important.
